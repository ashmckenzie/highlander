# Hilander

> There can be only one

## Intent

Hilanders goal is to encourage and promote awesome work through points and badges.  Focusing on rewarding great work through positive point allocation instead of negative point deduction is a major goal of the project.

## Getting started

1. Clone it
2. `bundle install`
3. `bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate db:data_migrate`
4. `rails s`
5. Hit `http://localhost:3000`

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

## Development notes

**We use the data_migrations gem for seed data**

To keep our data migrations seperate from the schema migrations*, we use [ashmckenzie](https://github.com/ashmckenzie)'s [data_migrations](https://github.com/ashmckenzie/data_migration) gem.

To create a new migration (e.g. add a new metric):

    $ rails g data_migration:new <name of migration>  # similar to rails g migration <name of migration>
    $ rake db:data_migrate                            # similar to rake db:migrate

Please see the [data_migrations docs](https://github.com/ashmckenzie/data_migration) for further info.

_*Please note this means the Rails migrations are for schema changes only_

**Adding a new Metric**

_(consider adding a wiki page for this)_

1. Write a capybara feature test (see spec/features for examples of what we test)
2. Watch it fail
3. Add your new metric to the database by running a data migration to add the new row to the metrics table (see above)
4. Add the metric name to the Metric::NAMES array. This automagically creates a new post endpoint in the format "/api/your-metric-name.json" - see the routes file, or run _$ rake routes_ to verify). All metric posts are redirected to the _events#create_ action, with the metric name merged into the params with key _:metric_.
5. Implement a *PayloadAdapter* for your metric only if the base one isn't compatible with the JSON payload you're expecting.
6. Implement a *PayloadValidator* for your metric only if you require additional/customised checks before creating the event.
7. Run your test again... watch it pass

**Configuring badges for your new metric**
